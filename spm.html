<PRE>
WHEN THERE IS NO HOPE IN SIGHT 
DISTRACTION CAN SAVE YOU!!
DISTRACT YOURSELF IF YOU CAN</H1>

Right ! -- As if "doing things" or "keeping busy" is going to help !!

 

Trust me, I know that
Nothing takes the pain away
And the mere suggestion that some of the silly ideas below could make you "feel better" may be offensive or upsetting to
those who are desperately depressed or overwhelmed by suicidal compulsions.
But until your treatment kicks in, you have to pass the time & get through the many moments of agony in the days ahead.
I really don't know how I made it through, but I did and I am glad to be here and I want to do what I can to help you get through.
 

What is help ??
Something that temporarily diverts you from attempting suicide.
Something that temporarily reduces awareness of pain.
Something that Keeps You Alive.
Sure ! Laying down sleeping, sitting, doing nothing is fine as long as you...
 
DON'T KILL YOURSELF !!
DON'T EVEN TRY.
Distractions can possibly help you stop thinking about it for short increments of time.
If nothing can distract you, if you are too suicidal, you may need to go into a hospital just to keep yourself from attempting suicide.

Distractions and stress relievers
Activities that you may find helpful in distracting you from the way you’re feeling and relieve some of your distress might include:

Listening to your favourite music as a mood booster
Taking a shower
Sitting outside or going for a short walk
Spending time with your family or friends
Watching a favourite DVD, television program or film
Drawing, sketching or painting
Writing
Re-connecting with areas of your life that give you a sense of meaning e.g. spirituality, social service, a vocation
Taking some time out to treat yourself to a small thing you ordinarily enjoy, and savouring it.
 

Look after your physical health
It is easy to neglect your physical health when you’re feeling distressed or suicidal, but paying attention to your diet,
 getting regular sleep, maintaining a daily routine and keeping active can help you to feel more able to manage things.

 

Relaxation techniques to help with suicidal feelings
It can be helpful to educate yourself about other coping strategies, such as relaxation techniques. There are various techniques 
that can help to reduce feelings of distress. There are a range of books or reputable websites available where you can learn more
 about these, but here are some examples to get you started.

 

Breathing exercises

Find a comfortable position. Focus on something in the room or close your eyes. Breathe in slowly through your nose, hold the breath
 for a few counts, and then breathe out slowly through your mouth. Hold your breath again for a few counts, and then repeat the process
 until you feel a little calmer.

 

Practicing mindfulness

Instead of trying to stop your distressing feelings or thoughts, try simply recognising and accepting them without judgement. Remember that you
 experience a whole range of thoughts and feelings apart from the ones you’re dealing with at the moment. Remind yourself that feelings and thoughts 
 are temporary and will pass.

 

Progressive muscle relaxation

Lying down or reclining in a chair, begin by breathing slowly. Starting with your feet and working your way up your body, tense each group of muscles for 10 seconds, 
then release them for 15 seconds.

 

Another important step in coping with suicidal feelings is to develop a suicide safety plan.

	<H1>HELP SOMEONE IN CRISIS</H1>
	It is highly likely that at some point in everybody’s life they may come across somebody who’s suicidal. <br>This is the best way to help:

<ul><li><b>Listen</b><br>
It is important that you listen, and do so without any judgement and acknowledging everything they are saying.<br> Give your complete attention.

<li><b>Show that you care</b><br>
This can be done by what you say, how you say it and body language. Let them know that you care about them, what they are going through and how they are feeling. Offer compassion, empathy and concern.

<li><b>Do not belittle</b><br>
Take whatever they are saying seriously and do not belittle whatever they are saying because it is their reality. Be respectful of the individual and do not make jokes or take what they say lightly.

<li><b>Be calm</b><br>
The person that you may be talking to might be distressed, be calm, and help them soothe their stressors. Don’t become alarmed or shocked about what they say or do. If you need help do reach out to one of their family members or friends or take the person to the nearest hospital.

<li><b>Do not leave them alone</b><br>
Make sure that you don’t leave them on their own till they have calmed down and assure you that they will not harm themselves. Ideally, wait till a family member, friend or colleague comes and collects them. Do follow-up after the episode.

<li><b>Don’t offer advice</b><br>
Your job is not to fix their problems by offering solutions. We can’t claim to understand what the person is going through and definitely aren’t professionally equipped to offer advice.

<li><b>Don’t promise confidentiality</b><br>
Individuals who are suicidal might tell you to keep it a secret. Don’t promise to keep it confidential. But communicate that with care and concern letting them know that you will only talk about this with a family member, friend or a mental health professional.

<li><b>Recovery and follow-up</b><br>
Offer to make an appointment with mental health professional and give them information on where they can seek help. Also follow-up on the person to check and see how they are doing.
